Keep a sharp eye on your %HEART METER%! Once you run out of hearts it's #GAME OVER# for you!
I just send a message out and another Zombie will answer back in no time.

Sorry, change of plans.
A wealthy man from beyond the wastelands has been pressuring me to sell the town.
You don't wanna be there when sis's eyes roll back and she goes freak show on ya.
Whew! Life as a #HALF GENIE# is hard work!
Genie girl!
Is it dangerous?
Yo lady. It's dangerous out there. I won't let you leave before visiting the #SAVE GUY#. He's back in Scuttle Town Square. Left side.
It's a puppy, its cuteness makes your heart sing!

You'll see!
What's going on?

This is someone's pet!
It was so sweet of them to help you out.
Otherwise it's just words. Okay?

What's left is… 
I don't know what that means, but it sure sounds difficult! Here's 300 gems!
#RISKY BOOTS#!
The #GENIES# banished its magic long ago.

I got kicked out of my old town and traveled here to start a new life. I really hope this town can accept me for me.

It could have gone differently you know.


When I need cash, I usually go Naga hunting.
Uncle, go now!

What's this?
You'd take me back, even without my genie magic?
You got a %MAGIC JAM%!
You wouldn't happen to have an egg I could borrow, would you?
And don't forget to leave room for %EGG%!
Cackle Cackle!
But Uncle!
Have you visited the shop? I traveled from far off lands to check it out myself, but once I arrived I had no money left to buy anything.
Stand back and watch me sizzle!
Let's see how you handle my brand new Steam Powered Oceanic Tinker Tub!
I like your hair.
You've been paid, now shove off!
Will you take the job?
Channel your passions and allow the magic to %TAKE SHAPE%! 
Sorry kid! You're full on those!

Tell 'em the #AMMO BARON# sent ya!

I suppose you're still angry with me.
And its %DARK POWER% will be mine!
You've learned a thing or two since our last duel.
It's the perfect staging ground for my new campaign!

Thanks Barracuda Joe!
We should rub bellies. It's lucky.
The chick with the brain?
As usual, we'll kick off the festivities by cracking open a fossilized treasure and offer the contents up for auction! 
Right, Wobble Bell?
Go see the #AMMO BARON#.
And just so there's no hard feelings, take this here.
Well, you remembered Poe's egg anyway, so at least he'll shut his gab.
Nice! You got a %KEY%!
No way! I can handle this! 
Please honor my request as a final act of service.
Take a look.
You found all %THREE% of my babies! I'm fit to burst!!

Temp Intro text!
Ever since this pirate thing started, Scuttle Town's been going to the dogs!
...

Now's my chance to get them to Uncle Mimic's #WORKSHOP# back in Scuttle Town.
I'll admit at first glance it seems pretty useless.

May fortune follow you in your travels.

Have you seen the other fisherman in this town? Talk about FAT!
Take them and run!
No! I forbid you to go!
Who are they?
Sample text

Speaking of which, do you have my %EGG%?

You got something for the Ammo Baron or not?
Oh, and I like mine with a little %ROTTEN EGG% mixed in.
No more zombie barista.

The #IMPORT ROOM# lady used to work at a bathhouse. I miss that place.


Have you been to the %FOREST CAVE%? It has a %LOCKED DOOR% inside. Perhaps I'll tunnel in there one of these days for a look see. Of course, it would be much easier If we had the missing %KEY%.

Who are you guys...

Wrench spotted a tent while flying over the desert. Maybe you should check it out.
Information that valuable is not given away for free!

You have GOT to try one of these!
Clock starts once you pass through that door.
I'm so pleased that you walloped that awful Squid Baron! I just know he stole %THREE% of my precious Magic Jams!
You can't tell where the foam ends and the scrambled eggs begin!

#POLYP BAY# is dangerous! Why does the Mayor hang out there? He really needs an office.
Hey, look who's back!

Do you know what she's talking about?

Like, we know your next stop is the #HYPNO BARON#.


Is that my #WOBBLE BELL#?

Oh, Wobble Bell! If only I knew where he went! He probably felt that I took him for granted and left me to find some other chef to inspire! And now, they are making wondrous dishes together and traveling the world. And let's be honest. I was taking him for granted. I rarely even fed him. And when he wanted attention I'd just push him aside and focus on my culinary arts. But now he's moved on, and my fate is sealed. Sure I'll cook, at first out of habit. But eventually I'll become a heartless automaton, marrying the first man that shows interest and I'll cook and I'll cook. People will come for miles to try my recipes, I'll be famous, and the world will become reliant on my food. Then Wobble Bell and I will meet at random and it will be awkward. I'll bury my feelings until one day I crack. And that will be it. I'll give up cooking and the world will have nothing to eat, and every living thing will starve and die out. The land will grow cold and life as we know it will cease. Oh Wobble Bell, please come back!

Scuttle Town ain't got room to dock 'em all.

Look, no need to get worked up. Right?

No one around here could possibly smash a #GOLEM#. So what's with the picket signs?
You're really pushing the boundaries of friendship here.
There, there. Everything's going to be ok.
Boulders, Golems, even Fire Breathing Statues. They are all made of stone. There must be a way to smash them apart!
Risky!

Gasp! She's right!

Oh boy it's a blob.


It's citizens only!

Not a chance! Back off, or I'll smash this thing to pieces! 
Ummm...There's supposed to be %ROTTEN EGG% in that.
When I grow up I'm going to master %FIRE MAGIC%!
What does this lamp do anyway?
Your genie friend should be arriving any moment now.
Stop it #ROTTYTOPS#.
Our offer is this.
It's clear that you love this town and will defend it to the end.
But…
If those zombies love coffee so much,
Are you all right?
Your Mother…

You got %FISH NIP%!
Looking for me?

Gone.
We've been doing a wagon tour, sampling the local cuisine.
Didn't you take it for a %SWIM% yesterday?
Absolutely! I'm going to have a talk with the Ammo Baron and get our town back to normal lickety split!
Who changed the Dock Manifest to say #AMMO TOWN#? Is this a joke?
This is the place! Should I stick the %PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE% here?
default
That is, my old basement. I had to rebuild this place when I went commercial, what with zoning laws and all.
If you still want to know the %SECRET% of the lamp, I'll show you!

You got all that?
They're waiting for you at the #BOAT HOUSE# up the coast.
You got %BOTTOM HALF OF SKULL%!
But I fear that making a tidy profit on the town moments before it's obliterated is the only solution.
wouldn't Rottytops have one?
Well, well, well. I see you managed to beat me to the first %MAGIC SEAL%!

I snagged one of those Jam things in my net, but that dopey kid threw it back.
Get going.
It's filled with tricks and traps.
The official map of Sequin Land!
Ah, you've arrived.
But he seems to have run away, and without him to inspire my dishes, my dream has fallen into ruin.

No need for alarm! 
Come on boy, let's do your thing!
I was there! That was just this morning.
I'm looking for a %MAGIC SEAL%
and I hear you have it.
I'm certain that the #SQUID BARON# stole %THREE% of my precious %MAGIC JAMS%. I hope someone finds them and puts them to good use.
When Risky Boots returns to rule over us, I'm planning to switch sides. Hey. It's survival.


He might be a stinker, but I think he's telling the truth.

%JUGS% are always filled with goodies, and come in all shapes and sizes! Smash them up!
All my friends live in Scuttle Town, and we're pretty happy with things the way they are.


Come on! Just a scout's taste!

I've let her, and everyone else down all because of my foolishness.
Shantae wake up!
You've got to accessorize! Get some %SILKY CREME% for that hair! It gives your hair full body and repairs split ends.
That does it!
Whether you believe me or not, that zombie and pirate are in cahoots, and that's a fact!
Sigh.
Risky Boots says she took your uncle, and will trade his life for the three %MAGIC SEALS% you've got.
What is that?
You're fired!
We have no choice.

Suit yerself!
We found a ransom note in his workshop.
In a few moments, the %LAMP% will be restored to full strength!

We're a whole town, we need complete protection!
To and fro, to and fro!
Sorry kid. Citizens only.

How do I get down from here?

You can at least tell me why Risky would steal it.
Ok, you've got yourself a deal.
I'm not a boy.
That or do a saucy dance.
The deal wasn't for cash! What about her brains!

The %MONKEY DANCE% will allow you to climb walls and leap to new heights!
Sometimes I fall asleep when no one is looking.
Don't leave town without a %SEQUIN LAND MAP%! It shows all the #SAVE ROOMS# and such. You can get one at the #SHOP# for super cheap!
Now that Wobble Bell is back home safely, my dream of becoming a famous chef can finally come true!
I feel strange on the inside and the outside.
Wrench reports signs of a camp way out in the desert. Could be a lead.

It's over, Risky!

Fine, we'll do this the hard way.

And afterwards, we must never speak of this again.
No, here.
Click Clack, wait for it...
You just missed my brothers.
See these arrow things on the ground? Folks call 'em %JUMP PADS%! Jump off'a one to launch forward or back. They'll take you straight to the #TOWN GATE#.
Uncle Mimic needs me!
Gotta keep your eye on the prize!

You've been skipping your %BELLY DANCE% classes? No wonder you can't remember any %TRANSFORMATION DANCES%!

So all along Risky had us thinking that the lamp was the weapon.
Huh? 

You're a lifesaver!
. . .
Let's see...
You might look like him, but you're not my uncle.
Risky's lair is #EAST# of here, just outside town in the deepest part of the sea.
You're the worst egg-sitter ever. 
Very funny. 
Sorry chica.

Spin a deadly %PIKE BALL% around your bad self

My babies are probably hiding in the undersea caverns close by.

My dad told me that when I grow up I will like girls. GROSS! That's not true, is it?
You got a %PASSPORT%!

I'm off to see your uncle's show.
With this lamp I've finally got the means to crush Sequin Land once and for all!

Come back once you have a %COFFEE MACHINE% and I'll help you out.
Uncle... my magic…
Oh Miss, how can I ever thank you?
I had a feeling you'd show up!
And I promise that from now on I won't be too proud to take help from others. Especially you guys.
Save complete!

You've outsmarted Risky Boots.
Hey, you made the coffee for my bros? That's so sweet! They're waiting for you at the Boat house!


A powerful artifact exists which allows a monkey to dash over #LARGE PITS# like a speeding bullet.
This would put him near the old Boat house!
Hold up, girly girl.
You sure are lucky you have your hair to use as a weapon. I'm forced to resort to meaty punches and stubby leg kicks.


Looks like we've got a winner!
We're here cause we got a proposition for you.

Mysterious power emanates from the magic seals

It's not your fault Uncle. The danger was always out there. I was the one who rushed in unprepared.


Mayor Scuttlebutt!
Thanks to you, I've got one rotten egg too many.
I'm afraid my patience for you is starting to wear thin. Why don't you hand over both %MAGIC SEALS% now, and save you and your dear #UNCLE# from any further unpleasantness?

Rat-a-tat!!
The townspeople will thank you!
Thieving bandits who pass themselves off as artifact collectors.

You have two, and now you're here for the %FINAL ONE%!
Please wait while I check your Nintendo DSi.
His oceanside fortress is impenetrable.
I'm sure that's normal!
It's a #LABYRINTH# that bores deep into the seaside cliffs.
Thank you Sky! Wrench!
Hiya Shantae.

In addition to blasting enemies, you can also destroy the %UNDERSEA BLOCKADES%.
Destroy this brat!
play with this!
Pull a fast one on ol' Barracuda Joe?
You're human now.
Out in the desert is a mysterious %TOWER%. Maybe one of your Baron guys lives there.
I don't know what that means, but here's 200 gems!
Don't leave town without buying magic from this #SHOP#! I'd start with %FIREBALL% magic if I were you. It's perfect for long range attacks, and will ignite certain enemies!
Give me everything you've got!
What have you done!

Hurry up and bring it inside!
Warp to #PUMPKIN PATCH#?
You got %MERMAID BUBBLE%! While swimming as a Mermaid, %ATTACK% to fire bubbles! 
It's okay, Uncle! Show us!
The secret entrance to #RISKY'S LAIR# is to the #EAST#, beneath the sea!

When you’re not sure what to do next, come talk to me, Bolo, or Uncle Mimic! You can find all three of us here in Scuttle Town. From now on, don’t be afraid to ask for help!

Half of a mysterious object
Aren't you a grump! 
Do you think you're up to the challenge? 
We get you in.
A potion 3 pack that's easy on the wallet!


You're the speediest planet hopper this side of the Milky Way?
Now get going, I'm a busy man!

Maybe you should sit down.

Welcome to the #ITEM SHOP#!
Quit being so shy!
My warbird hatchlings literally flew the coop.
If you're feeling rusty, hold the #X BUTTON# to do a practice dance.

If you agree to save my %THREE GOLDEN BABIES%, I'll show you how to open the path to Risky's hideout.
Shall I smash it open? 
No prob. Come back any time.

You're going to need a %COFFEE MACHINE%
But since you're a Half Genie, I figured why not use the lamp to %STRIP YOU% of your %POWERS%!

Lock and load men!
If only there was.
A % MAGIC SQUEAL%?
He was in rare form.
We'll attack from here.
But no matter.
But if you've got to trade them coffee, you'll need beans and a means to grind them up.
But...


Left of town is the #PUMPKIN FIELD#. Off to the right is the #LILAC FIELD#. Try not to get lost.
Why not train that bod at my private #BATTLE TOWER#?

No.

Plastic explosive? Let's blow something up!
Well, this takes the cake doesn't it? 
Is Risky Boots really going to destroy our town?

You met a #DANCE SPIRIT#? Lucky! I hear they reflect the face of those who find them.  Is that true?
Want some help with that?
This sounds fishy.

You fool!

Who's out there?
Don't you worry about a thing sweetheart!

...err, brought the wrong item. Uh, that is...
I'll give you one last chance to hand over that lamp!
Make sure you have the three basic magic types. You never know when they will come in handy!
You ain't gotta do it.
C'mon kiddos! Whoever has the %ARTIFACT%, give it to the nice lady!
Sometimes I wish I grew up to be a dancer instead of a jug holder.

Well.

What's shakin'?
YOW!
huge bowels... 
Now that the Risky Boots is plotting revenge, Sequin Land Palace is afraid to send wagons.
Are you serious? 

Nonsense!


Put it back before there's trouble!

Let's both be reasonable!
Now that I've got all three %MAGIC SEALS%, I half expected Risky Boots to make a grab for them.
I'm four!
No, I've never been to the Battle Tower. But I hear there are rewards for those who reach the top again and again.

You must be the genie, looking for the %MAGIC SEALS%, yes?
Life will never be the same, but at least Scuttle Town will be provided for.
Now to take this to the #BOAT HOUSE#!
Shantae, you can do it!
#BATTLE TOWER# rules are simple.
Any luck finding %COFFEE BEANS% or that %COFFEE MACHINE%?  I'm sure they're here in the forest!  
You're very very smart! 
Just west of here is a mysterious cave with a locked door inside. Did you check it out? 
Ok then.
Magic Potion for restoring health.



Things will be different from now on.
Hold on, Uncle! I'm on my way.
Voila!
Barons of Sequin Land?
Look who's back!

You're the delivery boy?


Whew!
not used
Ehhh heh heh...

Heave ho men!! 
That lamp is extremely dangerous!
You're the best pals ever!

All these boats comin' in. 
What are you tryin' to do?
No idea what that thing's for.
You got the %TOWN DEED%!

Hey, that's my home you're talking about!

Let's get this done quickly!
Well, what are you waiting for?

Risky wins this time. 
Hey, that coffee wasn't bad! Maybe you outta consider a career change.                  
It's about time you got here! I put my order in hours ago!
Shantae, there you are.
Pack up your things and clear out.
Kick her butt! Take her down hard!
Evil never rests.


not used
That's why I'd like you to return as Scuttle Town's guardian.
It's trouble.
There has to be some other way!
Miss Boots will be expecting to fight you on her terms.

Make sure you stop by the #SHOP# for some magic before you go! I'd suggest the %STORM PUFF%! It's the most powerful weapon to start with, even if it is tricky to use.
Risky! This is a new low!
Throw the Steam Powered Oceanic Tinkertub into overdrive! Let's see what this baby can really do!
You got %PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE%!
Fussy old explorers always find the weirdest stuff from the old world. 
Whee! It's Expo day! 
This year's mystery object appears to be encased in solid stone but feels quite hollow.

Oh, the genie.
Tsk tsk!
You've done it!
not used
You three!
So, you managed to solve my labyrinth!


Yeah, well about that… 
WHEEEE-ooo!
Then enjoy your victory!
You discovered a %FOREST LABYRINTH% with a #BOSS# inside? Well, you'd better head back there. Sounds like you need to find and defeat that guy.
She'd never!
The %MAGIC SEALS% are mine!
You got the %ELEPHANT DANCE%!
not used

GIVE RISKY THE %MAGIC SEALS%?
The %MAGIC LAMP% is back in action and ready to rock!!
Let's go. I got a feelin' things are about to get %MESSY%.

On my journeys I once came across a %GOLDEN SQUID BABY%.
You brought back a %GOLDEN BABY%!
Hey!
It's just a worthless lamp!
Ka-Boosh!
In return, you gotta brew us some %COFFEE%.
I need help coming up with a plan!
After all, there aren't any real Genies left to enslave.
Three fireballs at the same time!
Without our fishing trade, Scuttle Town is all washed up. I was hoping not to resort to this, but here.

Hey Shantae!
Risky Boots and her Tinkerbats are still out there.
Sample text
Risky Boots!

We're now called #AMMO TOWN#? Lame!

No sign of Risky Boots, OR her pirate ship!
The #SQUID BARON# lives somewhere in this forest. Start with him.

Current probably carried it away by now. If only there was some way to swim down there and get it.

Just didn't have it in ya this time?
hit it with an %ELECTRICAL SPARK%, and stand back for the fireworks!
It took nerves of steel to do what you did. Destroying your magical half was pretty gutsy.

As a child I was raised by a family of squids. I never learned to warp though. That's a power they have that I will never understand. 
That's strange.
There's still time to stop you!
It will be difficult.
She's looking for the #THREE BARONS# of #SEQUIN LAND#.
From Scuttle Town?
That says it all.
The %MEGA PIKE BALL% has three balls with blades on them. It's super devastating!
not used
But he'll change his mind once I get that lamp back.
Don't stop until she's a stain on the floor!
Nevermind. I'll return this puppy myself.
Ahh, the lingering smell of kitchen spatter!
My men will march across the land like two tons of tactical tin toy terror!
Besides, why should I believe you?
If you find any %COFFEE BEANS% down there, you're welcome to them.

I don't know what C-Rank means, but here's 50 gems!

not used


What's this?
#VOICE:# I can help! 
Ladies and Gentlemen... my mistake! 
We'll track your best scores and all that...really make it worth your while.
I'm only Half Genie!
We can't go without Sky's %EGG%.
You beat Mighty Milky Way?
Blarrgh! NO %SMASH% ME!
Oh gross, now he's got a worm!
It ain't worth fightin' over.


You got a %LATTE%!
Open wide!
If it means saving our town from evil, you bet!

not used
Grip a wall, press away, and attack to dash like a bullet!
I hear you but…

I don't even know what that is!
Yeah. But as long as we stick together…
not used
Err... Uhh... 
And it's ladies night!
Ok, you're #Ret-2-Go#!




What do I owe ya?
Warp to #LILAC FIELDS#?

Repairs split ends for faster whipping
A strong cup o' joe's the only thing that separates us from them.
What do you know about that?


That way I can %BURN AWAY% anything in my path!
Ever since I ran Risky Boots out of town, every monster in Sequin Land wants a battle.
But don't worry! So now that you're my gal...
Yes, where to?
I sense a restless energy deep inside you.
The power to swim in deep waters!
So don't ask me to warp you to some other pedestal. Why not give it a shot? I pinkie promise you can always warp right back again!
Total disaster.
And put your backs into it!
If you're thinking about stopping by his place, better be on your toes.
My! No need to be hasty! I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty of each other down the line! Ta ta! 

Kablooey!
What am I supposed to do, sculpt my way in?
...and grasping the white crystal firmly in hand, I ducked for several seconds at what appeared to be a common cliff face until blah blah blah...
You found a broken %COFFEE MACHINE%!
Thanks! Anything else?

Don't run off again, Wobble Bell!
Ok.

That's probably not my pup.
…
And be sure to hit a #SAVE ROOM#, first stop on the left.
Not anymore.

There ain't no way you're breakin' in there without our help.
It's only temporary! 
Welcome Miss! I'm very sorry, but today's orders are all backed up!
Choose the File that should be copied.

Can you locate Risky Boots with that?

I'd save the world with you, but I'm on break.
Can I really trust these guys?
I sense a restless energy deep inside you.
You are a hottie boom-ba-lottie!


Hmm…There's something different about this door.


All I need now is a %BOLT OF ENERGY%!
The #WARP PEDASTALS# on the far East and far West ends of the ocean are connected. It's a great way to travel.
Warp to #MERMAID CLIFFS#?
Once captured, the genie must grant %EVERY WISH% her master desires, no matter how evil! 
Candy! 



...
Wasn't sure you'd keep your end of the deal.
But how could it work on me?
Phooey with half genies!
Sometimes I bathe in my own sweat. Don't tell anyone.
May fortune follow you in your travels.
Where do I start?


To change back, press the #X BUTTON# again!
Maybe you should have just handed over those %SEALS% in the beginning and saved your friends from such grief!
Warp to #TANGLE FOREST#?
Just flash 'em your %PASSPORT%.
...and with my emptied bowels replacing the treasure, I was able to outwit the pressure trap and make my escape! 
Even if the %DARK POWER% was somehow restored, few remember how to use it.


Then let the festival begin!
#CROWD:# Show us! Yaaaaay!
I thought the #AMMO BARON# only kept valuable treasures up there!


Sample text
Retracing your steps is a great way to find rare treasures.

I'm famous for my Magic Jam! It spreads like a dream and tastes like a blot of heaven! Too bad monsters hijacked my latest batch.
We've run out of visitor badges. This is bad. 
If you find it, it's yours.
Sample text

I always pre-register!
Swag!
Man that hit the spot!


#CROWD:# Ooooooh... MURMUR... 
You'll both beg for mercy in the end!
Thanks everyone. But still… I feel farther from my mother, from my true home than ever before. 

Uhh.....
The town even smells worse!
...
Nice! You found a %COFFEE MACHINE%!
May fortune follow you in your travels.
The lunch courier?
Put 'er there, soldier!
Who are you, Ka-Pow?
She will never be able to restore the %MAGIC LAMP% now!
But if you have what it takes to destroy your uncle,


Copy to which location?
Sample text
Please, can I have my precious %PUP% back?
So long as you brought %TASTY MEAL%!
The pirate lady was threatening me and my babies if I didn't hand over my Magic Seal.
Get going!
They mostly gather old magical trinkets and such.
NO!!
I promised your mother never to speak of it.
Looks like a broken Coffee Machine. Who can fix it?

It's incredible! It's edible! It's a jar of Magic Jam!
She was spotted in Scuttle Town today.
Ok sister, I getcha.
So come back anytime for a rematch, and I'll set you up with some real prizes you can use. 
Let's see what'cha found up there!
You found a %HEART HOLDER%! You can now take more damage than before!

Enjoy your prizes, and come back soon!
I started dancing from a young age and never stopped. Now, it's all I know.
But there's a back door to her hideout that might just give you an advantage.
Sample text
So, now I just wander aimlessly on its roof!
Risky thinks one of them has a %MAGIC SEAL%! 
I wonder if the change of ownership of the town will affect my job.
I guess you've got no choice but to work with this squid guy! Better talk to him.
Till then...


So. Did you take good care of him?

#ABNER CADAVER#. The oldest.
Never!

Every time I see a monster, I kill it! Usually in the most brutal way I can think of. It's the best way.

That means he's over by the Mayor's private retreat?
Well this is a fine how do you do!
Have you ever heard of a %MAGIC SEAL%?
Also, a lot of folks die trying, so I hope you %SAVED% first.
I love skinny dipping in the far end of #POLYP BAY#. There's an undersea cave where you can hide if any boys show up.
You might have to trust this guy.
What he DOES need is that rundown rat's hole #SCUTTLE TOWN#!
Ho ho ho!
You can find it underneath that #BOULDER# out front. 
I don't know what B-Rank means, but here's 75 gems!
If I've lost her, I'll never live it down!
And better left forgotten.
The %MEGA PUFF% magic can obliterate almost anything. You should try it!
Try visiting your pal #ROTTYTOPS#. You can find her %ZOMBIE WAGON% by heading #EAST# from the town gate.  It's a straight shot right through the field and forest.
Come back any time!
East?
not used
We are now a military town? If they start raising us kids to be deadly assassins, I'm going to use my power to combat the evil that has taken a stranglehold on the town.
#CROWD:# Yaaaay! Do it! Clap clap clap!
We're all family now!

But your uncle.

Where ya going?
I'm #HUMAN#!
They divided its power into %THREE MAGIC SEALS%, and hid them away forever. 


And once you do, snap some close-ups.

To change back, press the #X BUTTON# again!
Lying down on the job while that pirate runs pell-mell all over my town?


Somethin' worth somethin'.
When I moved to this town, I owned a monkey, but a couple weeks after arriving, he was gone.

I don't know what that means, but here's 200 gems!
You've got %COFFEE BEANS% and a %COFFEE MACHINE%!?
It ain't clay. 
With that thing you can fire bubbles in %MERMAID FORM%.
Sample text
If Risky's hideout is under water, my birds can't do squat for you.
Ho ho ho!

You beat Mighty Flip Champs S-RANK?!


and some fresh %COFFEE BEANS%.



We'll celebrate by trying out my latest recipe!

Sample text
Why would you come here?
not used

Save Uncle Mimic before it's too late!
Persistent damage with maximum range
And I intend to carry that secret to the grave!
You're not going to like this.
Warp to #BARON DESERT#?

Fu fu fu!
What? Why not?
Ahhhhh!
Hmm. Either way she knows I'm coming. What do you guys think?

The #RELIC HUNTER EXPO# is today?
Maybe you should talk to that little #CHEF# girl who lives out in the forest.
Find the #AMMO BARON# and give him this %DEED%.

I left it sunning in the bay!
I enjoy standing. That, and looking.
You managed to find some %COFFEE BEANS%? Nicely done!
